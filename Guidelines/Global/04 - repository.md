# Flows' repository

The Global RTM Repository module provides access to all shared *survey flows* template files.

> A [RapidPro](https://rapidpro.ilhasoft.mobi) flow is a JSON structured file and you probably won't be able to read it with a regular text editor. A RapidPro administrator has to import that JSON file in the respective UNCT workspace.

## Viewer and Administrator perspectives

In this particular case, features for both account levels are the same, let's walk through each one.

### All flows

This is the Repository's homepage, where all available flows to download are listed.  
It will present the survey title, the UNCT that uploaded it and a short description provided by the administrator who created that flow.

## Search

There's a search bar to find surveys, you just need to type and press enter. It's case insensitive and capable of searching for strings' fragments at the survey name or description.  
In the example below the search was *"flow"* and it found five surveys where the string was found in different spots from multiple workspaces.

> You can clear the search anytime just by clicking the **X** button at the right side of the bar.

Besides *survey flows* it's possible to search for UNCTs names. See below a search for "brasil".

> Note that a flow main language may not be the one you're looking for, but there could be a translation for it as one of the flow's secondaries languages.

At the UNCTs session, it's possible to sort by Newest or Alphabetically as well.
