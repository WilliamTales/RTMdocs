## List

The homepage of UNCTs' session is a list of all registered UNCTs. Where some actions are available, let's walkthough it all.

### Sorting

You can choose to sort by *Name*, *Timezone* or *Language*. The first click will apply alphabetically descending order and the second ascending.

### Search

There's a search bar to find registered UNCTs, you just need to type and press enter. It's case insensitive and capable of searching for strings' fragments at the *name* field.
In the example below the search was *"L"* and it found three UNCTs where the string was found in different spots.  
You can disengage the search filter by clicking the **X** at the right of the bar. //TODO the option isn't available yet.

First inputs are relative to platform properties. *Name* and *Language* are free to choose, but *RapidPro URL*, *RapidPro Token* and *Timezone* should match exactly the values from the respective RapidPro workspace.

//TODO additional content to be commited soon!

You can start editing UNCTs just by clicking the pencil icon at its right side. You will have access to all fields.

**CAUTION!!!**  
Pay attention to the field you're editing. Saving incorrect values will make the UNCT workspace become inacessible and may affect values accuracy.  
Editing *RapidPro Token* or *Backend configuration* values is strongly not recommended and should be done only if oriented by a support member in very specific situations.

It's possible to edit UNCT's account levels directly from *Global workspace*, just click the group icon on its right side and those UNCT users' list will be loaded.
