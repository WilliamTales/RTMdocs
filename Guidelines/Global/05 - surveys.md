# Global Surveys

## Starting a Global Survey

Clicking the *+ Global Surveys* button will allow you to start a new event. Where all it's needed is to provide a *Title*, *Date range* and a *Description*.  
The *title* is how UNCTs' workspaces are going to choose which global survey to connect, so it's a good practice to make it short and self-explained. *Start Date* and *End Date* will set the results' range considered as relevant for this event. A *description* will explain the survey at the *Surveys Result* page.

Before clicking *OK* make sure you have checked the *Is active* option or the survey will be saved with *deactivated* status.

When you've completed this process, the *global survey* will become available for connection at UNCTs' workspaces by activating *Connect to on ongoing global survey*.

> The example below is an image from a local workspace.

### Connection evaluation

Clicking the **+** icon on the survey right side will open the evaluation module.

![surveysGconnectevaluation](../../_images/surveysGconnectevaluation.png)

Than you'll see two tabs, *Pending* and *Approved*.  
On *Pending* there's a list of all surveys requests. Clicking the survey *Name* will open the UNCT's respective content and the icons on its right side will approve or deny the request, respectivelly.

On *Approved* you can also load the respective content by clicking the survey name. The **X** button will unlink that survey from the global event.

## Searching

There's a search bar to find surveys, you just need to type and press enter. It's case insensitive and capable of searching for strings' fragments at the name of active or inactive surveys.
In the example below the search was *"global"* and it found three surveys where the string was found in different spots.  
You can disengage the search filter by clicking the **X** at the right of the bar. //TODO the option isn't available yet.

## Sorting

It's possible to sort surveys by *Name*, *Date* and *Status*. Clicking the option once will sort ascending and the second time will apply descending.  

Sorting can be a very useful tool as your survey's list grow bigger, in the example below there's a search for *"global"* and it's also sorting the list by *Initial Date*.

## Disabled Surveys

A grayed survey line means that it has been disabled and become inaccessible. A disabled survey won't have its results synchronized.  
In most cases disabling a survey means that the result is no longer necessary or something went wrong with it.

## Surveys' results

Here, you will find all surveys that were registered as *Global* on UNCTs. *Survey results* can be analyzed by selecting a survey on the survey's list.

![surveysGResults](../../_images/surveysGResults.png)

When choosing a survey on the list you will be redirected to the survey results page, which displays all details and charts.  
It will show you how many questions have the selected survey, its *Title*, *Description*, *Date* and *Linked SDGs*. There's also a counter for applied UNCTs in this Global survey.

![surveyGResultsHome](../../_images/surveyGResultsHome.png)

It's also possible to use the left panel and filter by SDG displaying only the questions that match the ones selected.

//TODO update Search tutorial content.

### Results' balance

By clicking *Countries* arrow option a list of connected UNCTs will load so you may choose one to balance the results.

![surveyGResultsBalance](../../_images/surveyGResultsBalance.png)

Now, it's possible to collate each question's result by clicking the *More* arrow.

![surveyGResultsCollate](../../_images/surveyGResultsCollate.png)

For each question, there's *engagement counter*, for applied UNCTs' surveys that has this question, and a *segment by* option to filter results by *Age* or *Gender*.
