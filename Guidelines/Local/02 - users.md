On your first login, you'll receive *viewer* access permission.  
If you want new user access, a UNCT administrator needs to change your access.

The home page for all logged accounts is the Dashboard.

Changes take effect immediately but if the modified account is still logging while being edited a fresh login may be needed.

> Note that it isn't possible to edit the account's personal data, if necessary that should be requested directly to a UNCT administrator and the RTM will inherit the info uppon a fresh login.
