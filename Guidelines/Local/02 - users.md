# Users

Account's management area that allows access level control and account removal.  
On your first login, you'll receive *viewer* access permission.  
If you want new user access, a UNCT administrator needs to change your access.

The home page for all logged accounts is the Dashboard.

## Viewer

Allowed to access UNCT's **Dashboard**, **Repository** and **Surveys** a viewer account can only see the data already there.

Changes take effect immediately but if the modified account is still logging while being edited a fresh login may be needed.

> Note that it isn't possible to edit the account's personal data, if necessary that should be requested directly to a UNCT administrator and the RTM will inherit the info uppon a fresh login.
