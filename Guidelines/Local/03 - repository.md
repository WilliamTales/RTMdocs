# Flows' repository

The RTM Repository module creates a collaborative ecosystem<!-- gives the opportunity --> to share *survey flows* template files. By sharing surveys, administrators can contribute to more success cases' with UNCTs aiming the same goal.  
[RapidPro](https://rapidpro.ilhasoft.mobi) is the platform that empowers social programmes within the necessary environment for collecting communities' thoughts and its core resides in *Flow* feature.

> A flow is a JSON structured file and you probably won't be able to read it with a regular text editor. A RapidPro administrator has to import that JSON file in the respective UNCT workspace.

## How to share

Only administrators can add new flow files, and it's possible to choose to share it restricted to the UNCT you're in or globally.

### Upload Flow

Share flows from RapidPro on RTM is a simple process. On the side menu, you have the option Upload Flows which leads the user to a form where the survey (flow) can be registered.

## Search

There's a search bar to find surveys, you just need to type and press enter. It's case insensitive and capable of searching for strings' fragments at the survey name or description.  
In the example below the search was *"flow"* and it found three surveys where the string was found in different spots.

> Note that a flow main language may not be the one you're looking for, but there could be a translation for it as one of the flow's secondaries languages.
