# String Definitions

**account**  
It's the user access for system-defined services.

**credentials**  
The account's *username* and *password* you may use in order to reach appropriate access to the restricted area.

**user**  
A Person that has access to the system.

**final user**  
People that are interacting with the programme.

**administrator**  
Also called *admin*, it's the major account access level, where all administrative actions are available.  
There're two administrator types, in our case, *Global Administrator* and *Local Administrator*. Both have the same system's perspective, but *Global admin* has the power to create new UNCT's workspaces.

**viewer**  
Account access level were no data editing is allowed. Every new user will gain *viewer* level upon the first login, where all features are available for read-only access.

**platform**  
In our perspective, it's the foundation of grouped technologies that are used for running the programme. Similar to a system's core.

**workspace**  
For us, it's a dedicated area for each *UNCT* where restrictions apply individually and data is private. There's the *Global* workspace too, for managing a larger scope of actions focusing *UNCT's* administration from a wider perspective.

**Local workspace**  
Each UNCT has its own workspace, that's called *Local*.

**Global workspace**
It's the workspace that globally has access to all workspace's published data.

**admin bar**  
At the top of each page, there's a bar with all administrative options that your account has access to.

**session**  
It's an area of the workspace that's accessible for a user. *Global* and *Local* workspaces have their own dedicated areas.

# How to use this guide

## Good practices

All access to the RTM platform will be done using your Operational System's browser. The platform was developed and tested run in the most used browsers around the world.  
That said we strongly recommend using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) to garantee that features and actions work as expected. It's possible to download it [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/thank-you.html?statcb=0&installdataindex=empty&defaultbrowser=0#).

<!-- 
If you're Windows user and don't want to install Google Chrome, a good choice is updating your Edge version to the latest. Microsoft released a self updating verion that can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
